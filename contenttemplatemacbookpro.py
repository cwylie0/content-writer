"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>We understand, your DEVICE is critical. When it breaks, it can really mess up your day. If you are in need of SERVICE, let the professional repair technicians at iFixYouri help you out.</p>",
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each device has its own lifespan - some devices use higher quality components than others and can last years if properly maintained. And we all know what drops or water can do to electronics. The DEVICE has great build quality and design, but it isn't invincible. Since your device is of little use when broken, it's a good idea to bring it to iFixYouri for expert SERVICE.</p>",
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doing SERVICE yourself is not recommended since you might unknowingly cause more damage. Using the supplied shipping label, send your DEVICE to iFixYouri's mail-in center so our skilled technicians can inspect each and every component, pinpoint all issues affecting your MacBook Pro, and get them repaired the professional way.</p>"
