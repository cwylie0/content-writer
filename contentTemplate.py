    "<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The DEVICE has great build quality and design, but it isn't invincible. Since your device is of little use when broken, it's a good idea to bring it to iFixYouri for expert SERVICE.</p><p>&nbsp;<p>Each device has its own lifespan - some devices use higher quality components than others and can last years if properly maintained. Drops, water or liquid, even a jolt can damage your device. </p>",

Using the supplied shipping label, send your DEVICE to iFixYouri's mail-in center so our skilled repair technicians can inspect your device, pinpoint all/any issues affecting it, and get them repaired the professional way.</p>"
